project_functions: Contains all the functions used in the poject. This file imported into all other python files
2D annealing: Simulated annealing for 2 parameter
2D Newton: Newton method + testing for 2 paramaters + contour plots for all other results
3D annealing: Simulated annealing for 3 parameters
3D Newton: Newton method for 3 paramers
3D univariate: univariate method in 3dimensions
plot for part 3.5: The plot for task 3.5 also plotted in report. It also contains the report figure 4
project_v2: follows the script tasks up to 3.5, also contains a lot of testing.


Note: the simulating annealing parts take about 20 minutes to run (on my computer). For the contour plot, I copied the results into a listt in the 2D Newton method.
